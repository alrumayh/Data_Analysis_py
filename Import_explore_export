##To read (import) a csv file: 

name (or anything you want to call it) = “file path.csv”

DF (#this is a the name of your dataset from now on) = pd.read_csv(name)
or DF = pd.read_csv(name, header = None) # if your csv file doesn't have a header, since pandas will automaticly make the first row as a header. 
or DF = pd.read_excel() # if it is in an excel format

--

##To look at your data: 

DF.head() #view from the top 
DF.tail() #view from the bottom
DF.head(60) #it will show you the first 60 rows 

-- 

##To add a header for your dataset: 

headers = [“x”, “bayl”, …, “till you match all your column”]
DF.columns = headers 

--

DF.dtypes # to check data types

DF.describe() # return a statistical summary (including count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max)

DF.describe(include = "all") # provide a full summary statistics (including the above and unique, top, freq values; also will show column that does not have a numeric atributes!) 

--

##To show  the value counts of your category: 

DF["column"].value_counts()

--

##Exporting your dataset: 

path = “write the path where you want it to go to” 
DF.to_csv(path)

--

##To replace a value with NaN in your dataset, this will allow you to manipulate missing variables much easier later on

df1=df.replace('varibale value > e.g., 992',np.NaN)

##  I will update this file later
